    <h2 class="welcome">Welcome, I'm Katerina!</h2>
    <p class="self-intro">
      I recently graduated from Chandler Gilbert Community College <br />
      with an Associate's in Computer Science.I plan on pursuing a <br />
      degree in cyber security, but I'm currently taking a semester to <br />
      work on certificatons such as the CompTIA trio. As of right now, <br />
      I am a front desk agent and night auditor at Residence Inn-- but
      <br />
      am actively looking for opportunities to expand my technical skills!
    </p>

    <p class="warning">
      Please bear with me! I am currently in the process of restructuring my
      entire website. I plan on adding much more, I just found it helpful to
      start with a blank slate :) My progress plan involves getting all the
      information in and then doing a remodel

      <p class="about-me">
        <br /><br />
        While I lack professional experience in the technical field, I have been
        passionate about computers for many years. This is largely in part due
        to my time on a variety of robotics teams. I first started in FLL in
        2016 while in elementary school as part of the Goodman Gators. This
        sparked a love for technology that only grew. Throughout middle school I
        took STEM classes and participated in Vex, but what made me most excited
        was my high school participation in FIRST. <br /><br />
        I spent four years programming on the robotics team, and it inspired me
        to fully commit to computer science. Even though I did learn valuable
        hard skills revolving around Java and GitHub, I learned a great deal
        more of life skills, such as leadership and efficient teamwork. I
        learned how to troubleshoot, working through tricky problems, and how to
        research to avoid getting stuck. It encouraged a love for problem
        solving that I take with me in my day to day life. <br /><br />Because
        of this experience, it is driving me to continually learn more about
        computers. I am in the process of becoming a mentor for my old robotics
        team so I can continue to learn and share my love for the community, but
        I am also building knowledge outside of this. I am working to get the
        CompTIA trio, and will follow this with the CCNA certifications. I am
        improving my programming every day. And above all else, continuing to
        find new problems to solve and new things to learn.
