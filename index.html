      <br>
      I currently work for the Scottsdale Unified School District as an <br />
      IT Support Specialist II. I started this position in September 2024, <br />
      and here I have been able to begin professionally exploring technology. <br />
      I have an Associate's in Computer Science from Chandler Gilbert Community <br />
      College and am actively pursuing a degree in cybersecurity at ASU. While <br />
      doing this, I am also studying for my CompTIA A+ certification. I am <br />
      always trying to learn something new and explore technology to become <br />
      the best version of myself I can be! 
    </p>

    <p class="warning">
      Please bear with me! I am currently in the process of restructuring my
      entire website. I plan on adding much more, I just found it helpful to
      start with a blank slate :) My progress plan involves getting all the
      information in and then doing a remodel

      <p class="about-me">
        <br /><br />
        I have been passionate about computers for many years, and am excited to 
        have been given the opportunity with SUSD to explore this further. Not only 
        have I been able to learn more about the hardware side of technology and 
        troubleshooting with a variety of classroom systems, I have built important 
        relationships. Being able to solve the problems of teachers and other school 
        staff brings me joy as I know the work I do makes a direct impact. Helping 
        support teachers teach and seeing the help I can bring further encourages 
        me to learn more and more about technology, so I can continue to do this. <br /> <br />
        Prior to SUSD, I had no professional tech experience and instead largely 
        studied subjects and participated in robotics. This was where my love for 
        technology was sparked. I first started in FLL in 2016 while in elementary 
        school as part of the Goodman Gators.Throughout middle school I took STEM classes 
        and participated in Vex, but what made me most excited was my high school 
        participation in FIRST. <br /><br /> I spent four years programming on the 
        robotics team, and it inspired me to fully commit to computer science. Even 
        though I did learn valuable hard skills revolving around Java and GitHub, I 
        learned a great deal more of life skills, such as leadership and efficient 
        teamwork. I learned how to troubleshoot, working through tricky problems, 
        and how to research to avoid getting stuck. It encouraged a love for problem 
        solving that I take with me in my day to day life. <br /><br />Because of 
        this experience, it is driving me to continually learn more about computers. 
        I am in the process of becoming a mentor for my old robotics team so I can 
        continue to learn and share my love for the community, but I am also building 
        knowledge outside of this. I am working to get the CompTIA trio, and will follow 
        this with the CCNA certifications. I am improving my programming every day. And 
        above all else, continuing to find new problems to solve and new things to learn.
